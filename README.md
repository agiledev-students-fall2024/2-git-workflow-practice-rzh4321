## What I Found Interesting

This article talks about how AI is revolutionizing software development processes. I find it interesting that AI tools can now suggest code lines and automatically complete repetitive code which significantly speeds up development. It's exciting to see how these advancements in technology could not only reduce development time, but also increase accessibility for those who aren't experts in this field. I also find it very interesting how AI is enhancing project management, which is not something that's normally talked about. AI algorithms are able to estimate project completion times and even anticipate potential setbacks, which completely changes the field of project management. This level of automation can lead to even more efficient delivery of projects and a better workload balance for the development team.
